# Singleton Design Pattern Application

This project demonstrates a simple application using the Singleton design pattern in a .NET Core application.

## Features

- **Implementation of the Singleton design pattern**
- **A single class that represents the Singleton instance**
- **Simple .NET Core application structure**
